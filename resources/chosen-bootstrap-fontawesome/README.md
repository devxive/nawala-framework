chosen-bootstrap-fontawesome
============================

jQuery Chosen CSS from bootstrap variables and mixins with font awesome icons instead of sprites. 

What the hell does that even mean?
==================================

Just a fork of the chosen CSS which utilizes twitter bootstrap mixins to get rid of about 100 rows of css but most importantly uses your link color variable to make the active select gradient and font awesome icons to get rid of the chosen-sprite.png image.
