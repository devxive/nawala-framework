# Official GEO select lists (human readable versions)

Project Info
------------
Everything should be human readable. Country lists in applications are horrible ( tryout to find your country ;) ).
Customers and users (not developers) are always looking first for their country name in their own language because not everyone knows the english translation.

Feel free to commit your country name in your own language. If you don't want to fork, feel free to submit an issue.

Please Note : All countries need to be saved as UTF-8 - No BOM!

Future plans
------------
- More pre-build and ready to use listformats (eg. json, csv, etc...)


Uses and applications
---------------------
- ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes are three-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1, part of the ISO 3166 standardization published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to represent country, dependent territory, and special areas of geographical interest. They allow a better visual association between the codes and the country names than the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (the third set of codes is ISO 3166-1 numeric and hence offers no visual association). They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974.


Current officially assigned code elements
